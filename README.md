Assignment 0.

This assignment will be graded to make sure you understand how to use version control with remotes.

* Extend my starter code to create subtract, multiple, divide methods, etc.
* Create more instances of `Number` objects.

Each team member should clones this repository, repeatedly "pull" any updates from this remote (GitHub) in case other team members have commited changes, make one local change (e.g. add code somewhere) that successfully compiles and runs, commit the local change, and then push it to the remote for your teammembers (and me) to see.

Do not push broken code. A big idea and rule-of-thumb is that the "master" branch on the remote should always point to a working version of the project.
